# Each term is the sum of the two before it.

# Create a list of the first twenty Fibonacci Sequence numbers.

# Step 1: Define a function to generate the first n Fibonacci numbers.

# Step 2: Initialize the list with the first two Fib numbers.

# Step 3: Start a for loop to iterate until the specified n item.

# Step 4: Append the appropriate Fibonacci number to the end of the list.

# Step 5: Return the list from the function.

# Step 6: Print the list.
