# Import the random library.

# Create a function for printing a list of characters as a string.

# Create the driver function.

    # Randomly select a word for the game.
    # Create a list of underscores/blanks to be filled in.

    # Create variables for total guesses, wrong guesses, and guessed letters.

    # Use a while loop to keep playing until the word is found.

        # Take in user input.

        # Check if the input is more than one character.

        # Check if the character has already been used.

        # Add the letter to the list of guessed letters.

        # Initialize a loop counter index and a found boolean.
 
        # Loop through the guessed word.

            # Check if the input character matches the word's letters.

                # If it does, update the blanks list.

                # Update the "character found" boolean.

            # Increment the character index.

        # Display a message for if a character wasn't found.

            # Increment the number of wrong guesses.

        # Display a message for if a character was found.

        # Determine if the player has won to break the loop.

            # Report the user's guess counts.

# Execute the driver function.

# Bonus: How can we pull the wordlist from a "dictionary" file?
